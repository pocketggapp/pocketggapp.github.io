                <p>pocketgg has been rewritten from the ground up, featuring OAuth 2.0 login, a more refined user interface, and some long-awaited improvements.</p>

                <li>Searching for tournaments now yields much more accurate results</li>

                <li>You can now add any video game from start.gg's database, and no longer have to manually send in a Video Game Update Request for games that are missing</li>
                <li>Tapping a set/match now shows the station and stream it's being played on (if available), as well as the seeds of both players</li>
                <li>Added color indicators to indicate which sets/matches are in progress</li>
                <li>Added support for Swiss brackets</li>
                <li>Added the ability to add a tournament directly to your calendar</li>
                <li>Added the ability to filter a TO's tournaments to those that they are directly organizing, are an admin of, or are competing in</li>
                <li>Added an 'Online' section to the main screen for all online tournaments</li>
